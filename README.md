# LFGEnhanced

A minimal UI addon that adds additional features to the LFG List tool added to
World of Warcraft Classic for Wrath of the Lich King.

This is a very early proof of concept meant to fill some gaps I personally
wanted to address in the tool.

## Features

- Automatic background search of listings for the same criteria you have
  listed yourself when your listing criteria consists of activities which use
  "Dungeon Role Expectations".
