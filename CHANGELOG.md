# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Split LFG/LFM messages between solo and party leader entries.
- Display candidate roles by what your party needs, assuming it's a typical 5-man
  configuration.

## 0.1

- Added basic auto-search functionality. This only auto-searches when you list
  yourself for activities which the API reports as using "Dungeon Role
  Expectations."
